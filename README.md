# Django Rest Framework Python3 Walkthrough 
a personal project moving from monolith Django apps to using a RESTful API

Django Rest Framework is great and love the project.
However, the quickstart docs use virtualenv and py2.X.X and I try not to roll like that.

This project for me is an attempt to provide more of a direct map of how to get up and rolling with Django, DRF, Conda as a package manager and condaenv as a virtual environment.  
My aim is to minimize your web searching as I have done my best to include nearly every step I could think of, with comments.
This repo is meant to SUPPLEMENT the DRF quickstart docs.  Please follow those at the same time.
The DRF docs provide much more insight into design choices and best practices, I'm not including
that info since it is already easy to find and done pretty well, imo.
This project/repo is to assist those looking to get up and running with DRF, Python3 and Conda with minimal fuss
and hopefully avoid some of the time sinks I have encountered in the same process.


# Requirements:
Conda (Python package manager, analogous to pip)
Python 3.6
Django 1.11
DjangoRestFramework 3.7

I am currently running Ubuntu 16.04.

# Goals:
Display a clear path for creating a back-end Django application that serves info in a RESTful manner.
