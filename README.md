# Django Rest Framework w/ Python3 & Conda: A Walk-through 
A personal project to learn about moving from a monolith Django project to using a RESTful API

Django Rest Framework is great and I really appreciate the project.
However, the docs use virtualenv and Python 2.X and I try not to roll like that.

This project is an attempt to provide more of a direct map of how to get up and rolling with Django, DRF, Conda as a package manager and condaenv as a virtual environment.

My aim through documenting this process is to minimize your time searching the web. 
I have done my best to include nearly every step.  Some steps I did not deem worthy to include as they do not
differ very little (if at all) from the DRF docs.
Docs in this repo with the title *Verbose include additional comments about the process.
Docs in this repo with the title *Supplement are meant to be a more direct guide on how to complete specific exercises.
This repo is meant to SUPPLEMENT the DRF quickstart and tutorial docs.  Please follow those at the same time.
The DRF docs provide much more insight into design choices and best practices, I'm not including
that info since it is already easy to find and done pretty well by people with more experience and more knowledge than me.

# Goals:
This project/repo is to assist those looking to get up and running with DRF, Python3 and Conda with minimal fuss
and hopefully avoid some of the time sinks I have encountered in the same process.

Display a clear path for creating a back-end Django application that serves info in a RESTful manner.

# Requirements:
Conda (Python package manager, analogous to pip),
