# Django Rest Framework Python3 Walkthrough 
a personal project moving from monolith Django apps to using a RESTful API

Django Rest Framework is great and love the project.  
However, the quickstart docs use virtualenv and py2.X.X and I try not to roll like that.

This project for me is an attempt to provide more of a direct map of how to get up and rolling with Django and DRF.  
Hopefully with minimal web searching as I have done my best to include nearly every step I could think of, with comments.

Requirements:
Conda (Python package manager, analogous to pip)
Python 3.6
Django 1.11
DjangoRestFramework 3.7

I am currently running Ubuntu 16.04.

Goals:
Display a clear path for creating a back-end Django application that serves info in a RESTful manner.
