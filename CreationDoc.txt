#how I can recreate || retrace my steps for future projects or revisions


open a new terminal session, navigate to new directory, git init 
add in readme doc, cheatsheets, whatever else to keep it organized
create new repo on github, set this as "origin" or whatever name, 
set new GH repo as the new local project dir's remote repo

''' have encountered an install error with $pip install django
in order to resolve this error, I have done the following:
sudo python3 -m pip install django
sudo python3 -m pip install djangorestframework
'''

#be sure to use $python3 for all python calls
